                GIT COMMANDS
    

    1) git stash -
            git stash temporarily shelves or stashes changes you've made to your working copy so you can work on something else, 
	    and then come back and re-apply them later on. he git stash command takes your uncommitted changes both staged and unstaged, 
            saves them away for later use, and then reverts them from your working copy. 
            We can reapply previously stashed changes with git stash pop. Alternatively, you can reapply the changes to your working copy 
            and keep them in your stash with git stash apply

        Syntax: git stash

    1) git remote -
            The git remote command lets you create, view, and delete connections to other repositories. Remote connections are more like 
            bookmarks rather than direct links into other repositories. Instead of providing real-time access to another repository, they
            serve as convenient names that can be used to reference a not-so-convenient URL.The git remote command is also a convenience 
            or 'helper' method for modifying a repo's ./.git/config file.

        Syntax :

        git remote ->  List the remote connections you have to other repositories.

        git remote -v -> Same as the above command, but include the URL of each connection.

        git remote add <name> <url> -> Create a new connection to a remote repository. After adding a remote, you’ll be able to use ＜name＞
                                      as a convenient shortcut for ＜url＞ in other Git commands.

        git remote rm <name> -> Remove the connection to the remote repository called ＜name＞.

        git remote rename <old-name> <new-name> -> Rename a remote connection from ＜old-name＞ to ＜new-name＞.

    3) git rebase -
             Rebase is used to apply a sequence of commits from distinct 
             branches into a final commit. It is an alternative of git merge command. In Git, the term rebase is referred to as the process 
             of moving or combining a sequence of commits to a new base commit. 

         Syntax:  git rebase <branch name> 

    4) git verify-commit
             The git verify-commit command will check the gpg signature. GPG or “GNU Privacy Guard” is the tool used in sign files and contains 
             their signatures.

         Syntax:  git verify-commit <commit>

    5)  git verify-tag
             you can confirm a tag.
 
          Syntax: git  verify-tag <tag>

    6) git diff
             Most of the time, you need to compare two git files or branches before you commit or push. Here is a handy command to do that. 
     
        Syntax:
              i) to compare the working directory with the local repo: git diff HEAD <filename>

             ii) to compare two branches: git diff <source branch> <target branch>

    7) git clean
             You can deal with untracked files by using the Git clean command. You can remove all the untracked files from your working 
             directory by using this command. In case you want to deal with tracked files you need to use the Git reset command.
         
         Syntax: git clean
      
    8) git whatchanged
             This command does the same thing as git log but in a raw form.
         Syntax: git whatchanged
