   MERGE CONFLICT DETAILS


   1) Firstly I created a text file named git_commands in main branch and edited it using vim editor from main branch itself.

   2) Added the file using "git add ." command and Commited the changes from the main branch.

   3) Created a new branch named osoc_task using command git branch <branch_name>

   4) Switched to the osoc_task branch and opened the git_commands text file and added 2 git commands.

   5) added the file using " git add . " command. 
   
   6) Commited the changes from osoc_task branch itself.

   7) Switched to the main branch.

   8) Tried merging osoc_task with the main branch.

   9) Merging Conflicts arised in the git_commands file because it was being edited by both the branches i.e main as well as osoc_task 
      so the git had a confusion about changes should be consideredand and thus merging failed.


   RESOLVING MERGING CONFLICTS

   1) Opened the git_commands text file using vim editor.

   2) Some lines were higlighted by the git that highlighted lines indicated the conflict region.

   3) This conflict region is nothing but the part where we edited from osoc_task branch.

   4) Removed those higlighted conflict lines.

   5) This ensured git that changes made from osoc_task branch was also to be considered.

   6) Now, closed the file.

   7) Wrote command "git status" to check whether merging conflict was resolved or not.

   8) Since it was resolved, i merged the osoc_task branch with main branch.
